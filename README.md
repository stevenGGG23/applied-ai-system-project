# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable.

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.
- Hard mode is somehow easier than Normal.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🐛 Known Bugs (Spoilers — try to find them yourself first!)

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|------|-----|-----|
| 1 | `app.py` | Secret number re-rolls on every rerun | Guard all state init with `if key not in st.session_state` |
| 2 | `app.py` | New Game doesn't clear guess history | Add `st.session_state.history = []` to the New Game handler |
| 3 | `app.py` | Invalid guesses consume an attempt | Refund the attempt counter when `parse_guess` returns an error |
| 4 | `logic_utils.py` | Hard range was `1–50` (easier than Normal's `1–100`) | Changed Hard range to `1–200` |
| 5 | `logic_utils.py` | "Too High" on even attempts rewarded +5 points | Both wrong-guess directions now deduct a flat 5 points |
| 6 | `logic_utils.py` | Misleading `# FIXME` comment on correct hint logic | Removed the comment |

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask an AI assistant: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong, the difficulty ranges are broken, and scoring is unfair. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.**
   - Confirm all logic lives in `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

### Game Purpose
This is a number guessing game built with Streamlit. The player picks a difficulty level (Easy, Normal, or Hard), which determines the range of possible numbers and the number of attempts allowed. Each round, a secret number is randomly chosen and the player must guess it within the attempt limit. After each guess, the game provides a hint — "Go Higher" or "Go Lower" — to help narrow it down. Points are awarded for winning and deducted for wrong guesses, with bonus points for winning in fewer attempts.

### Bugs Found

1. **Secret number re-rolled on every rerun** — clicking Submit triggered a Streamlit rerun, which re-executed `random.randint()` and generated a new secret before the guess was even checked.
2. **New Game didn't clear history** — old guesses carried over into the new round because `st.session_state.history` was never reset in the New Game handler.
3. **Hard mode range was smaller than Normal** — `get_range_for_difficulty("Hard")` returned `(1, 50)`, making Hard easier to guess in than Normal's `(1, 100)`.
4. **Score asymmetry** — "Too High" wrong guesses on even-numbered attempts were rewarded +5 points instead of deducted, making the scoring inconsistent.
5. **Misleading FIXME comment** — `check_guess` had a comment implying the hint logic was reversed, but the logic was actually correct, causing unnecessary confusion.

### Fixes Applied

1. **State guards** — wrapped all `st.session_state` initialisation in `if key not in st.session_state` checks so values are only ever set once per session, not on every rerun.
2. **New Game handler** — added `st.session_state.history = []` and `st.session_state.score = 0` to fully reset the game state on a new round.
3. **Hard range corrected** — changed `get_range_for_difficulty("Hard")` to return `(1, 200)` so difficulty scales correctly: Easy (1–20), Normal (1–100), Hard (1–200).
4. **Score fix** — removed the even/odd attempt condition from `update_score`; all wrong guesses now deduct a flat 5 points regardless of direction.
5. **Removed stale comment** — deleted the misleading `# FIXME` comment from `check_guess` since the hint logic was already correct.
